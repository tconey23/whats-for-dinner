### Context:
[//]: <> This project was completed over the two week winter break for Mod 1.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> Tom Coney https://github.com/tconey23

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> The goal was to effectively use HTML, CSS and JavaScript together in order to create a working application within the parameters of the project spec

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> One of the things I found most challenging was arranging elements properly with CSS. However throughout the course of working on this project I believe I have turned this into a 'win'. Another 'win' was realized during the refactoring stage. Consolidating CSS styles for for multiple elements by utilizing class names where needed.
